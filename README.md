<h1 align="left">Hey 👋 I'm Deni</h1>

<p align="left">
MSc student in Computer Engineering at <b>CIC-IPN</b> (Mexico City).<br>
Eternal learner building projects at the intersection of <b>algorithms</b>, <b>data</b>, and <b>scientific outreach</b>.
</p>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

<p align="left">
✨ Currently building my GitHub portfolio (one commit at a time).<br>
📚 Learning: Git/GitHub workflows, Python foundations, and Manim for scientific animations.<br>
🎯 2026 focus: thesis groundwork + consistent project shipping + clearer technical writing.<br>
🧠 Interests: algorithms, graph-based thinking, neural networks (intro level), and signal processing basics.<br>
👩‍🏫 Side quest: I teach science to kids in my free time.
</p>

<h2 align="left">What you'll find here</h2>

<ul>
  <li>📌 Learning projects (Python, SQL, R) with clean notes and small experiments</li>
  <li>🎬 Manim animations to explain algorithms / data structures (work in progress)</li>
  <li>🧪 Early research notes and reproducible code (as my thesis takes shape)</li>
</ul>
